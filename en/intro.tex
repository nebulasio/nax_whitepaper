Nebulas is an open-source, public blockchain focused on creating a true
\textbf{Autono-mous Metanet}~\cite{AutonomousMetanet}. Nebulas' focus utilizing on-chain data for users interactions and collaboration. Our core principal is \textbf{Let everyone get values from decentralized collaboration fairly through technical ways such as blockchain.}~\cite{vision}

This \textit{Orange Paper} will introduce how Nebulas uses its innovative technology to realize its vision of creating a \textbf{collaboration model with the help of unique innovative technologies to manage on-chain public assets and to realize the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)~\cite{DAO} which will provide positive incentives and self-evolution}. Nebulas governance has been designed with the following three aspects which will be explained one by one:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Organization and supervision}:
	Nebulas Community Groups which operate independently and constrain one-another: Nebulas Council, Nebulas Foundation, Nebulas Technical Committee; detailing their member composition, power, and obligations.
	\item \textbf{On-chain collaboration}:
	The process of community collaboration and system upgrade via \textbf{NAT On-chain Voting} (\ref{nat}).
	\item \textbf{Economy and incentive}:
	The economy of NAT On-chain Voting, the process of Nebulas governance and how this economy model provides positive incentives to each member within the community.
\end{enumerate}
