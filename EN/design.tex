\section{Economic Design of the NAX Token}
\subsection{Design Goal}
While the NAX token has been designed to increase ecosystem activity, it's primary goal is to create a unique token economy where all can participate in voting, governance and even node selection for network decentralization. With these goals in mind, the core design of a public chain's token economy should conform to certain principles and objectives such as fair benefits to participants, positive incentives, logical simplicity and diverse utilization scenarios. 

By creating a token economy with these characteristics, the token naturally has a higher value which thereby promotes the development and expansion of the public chain and will make the entire ecosystem more dynamic. To sum up, NAX's design goals include:

\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{2cm}(a)]
    \item fair benefits
    \item positive incentives
    \item simple and easy to understand
    \item high utility
    \item smart and effective
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Core Logic}

\subsubsection{Equity Fairness and Legitimacy}
The effectiveness of a public chain's token economy comes from the fairness and legitimacy of asset acquisition. The requirements for acquiring assets should be simple, transparent and an identical process for the vast majority of people. In a public token economy, the assets owned are relatively fair and substantiated and due to this, the primary way to obtain equity of a token via a Pledging (staking) method is in line with the above requirements. Equity obtainment must not be due to unclear requirements or loopholes existing which lead to the phenomenon of poor asset allocation. The overall result of obtainment must be conducive to improved ecosystem development on the public chain.

Within the Nebulas ecosystem, the Pledging (staking) process of NAS to obtain NAX and its benefits are fair and equitable within the Nebulas Eco-Certified economy.

\subsubsection{Nebulas Smart Pledge}
Traditionally, the pledge method used requires users to transfer their assets into smart contracts for temporary custody and asset security is controlled via the smart contract. Unfortunately, security issues leading to comprimised assets via smart contracts is not uncommon. For example in 2016, the DAO project on Ethereum was comprimised and attackers used contract loopholes to claim assets which caused a huge economic losses for investors and made them doubt the safety of smart contracts. Due to this, pledging also puts great pressure on public chain project parties since a large number of assets are kept in a smart contract which makes them targets. Due to this, the management and security of smart contracts is a large development bottleneck. All assets on the blockchain are genuine and pledging simply locks in the liquidity of that asset - it does not validate the ownership of the asset (although it can be retrieved by calling the contract method) once transferred to the contract.

For NAX asset obtainment via staking, we propose a new mechanism entitled "Nebulas Smart Staking" which records the locking of liquidity via a smart contract between the Nebulas address owner and the pledge contract while ensuring the assets are still owned by the user. The role of the pledge contract is to simply verify the validity of the user's pledge by randomly checking the on-chain contract status and the pledging address. A  pledge is considered valid when the balance of the pledging address is equal or greater to the amount pledged to the smart contract.

The advantages of the Nebula Smart Pledge include:
\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{2cm}(a)]
    \item guarantees the user's asset identification
    \item motivates more users to participate in pledging
    \item asset security decentralization
    \item securitization and separation of asset liquidity
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{NAX Extended Model - NDM}
As mentioned above, on the basis of safeguarding the equity and legitimacy of assets, and ensuring the inviolable ownership of pledged assets, the user contributes the liquidity of their assets and in return, they obtain corresponding ecological rights and interests. We call this new mode of token issuance "NDM" (Nebulas Devotional Mining). 

The maximum amount of NAX tokens projected for release is 10 billion(\(10^{10}\)) with an issuance cycle of every 6,000 blocks (approximately once per day tokens will be distributed). The number of tokens issued per cycle decreases with an attenuation coefficient of $\mu=0.999$ (reduction of 0.001\% every cycle) which leads to distribution completion in about 12 years. The number of issued NAX changes every cycle as shown in \ref{dist}. The cumulative issued NAX number as shown in \ref{acc}.

    {10^10};

    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Distribution Model}
The dynamic distribution model referst to the fact that on the basis of issuance, some variables will be introduced to promote positive ecosystem growth. During the initial stage of NAX, we will introduce multiple variables which will control distribution such as pledge rate influence factor and a dynamically adjusted  distribution ratio based on the to the rise and fall (quantity) of pledged assets. Any undistributed NAX for a cycle will be rolled over to the following cycle leading to greater distribution based on the variables. As needed in the future, we will also introduce a more dynamic distribution model.

Therefore, for each period of $i$, the system will issue $C_i$ NAX to addresses currently pledging. When the system distributes NAX, it will determine a distribution coefficient $\lambda_i$ based on the current pledge rate level r (the total amount of pledged NAS / total NAS circulation) and distribute $C_i$$\lambda_i$ (0< $\lambda_i$<1) NAX. Remaining undistributed $C_i$(1 - $\lambda$) NAX will roll over which in turn increases the potentional total amount of tokens issued for the following cycle. Therefore, the \(i\) period issuance pool \(C_i = C_0 \mu^i + C_{i-1} (1-\lambda_{i-1})\) consists of two parts: The first part is the basic distribution and each period is continuously attenuated with an attenuation coefficient of $\mu$. The second part is the remainder of the previous issuance pool.

Among them, the distribution coefficient \(\lambda_i\) and the pledge rate \(r_i\) function relationship as shown in the following formula. For specific parameters, please refer to the appendix. The function relationship is shown in \ref{func}.

  \begin{equation}
    \lambda_i = l r_i^3 + m r_i^2 + n r_i
  \end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines = left,
        xlabel = {pledge rate $r_i$},
        ylabel = {distribution coefficient $\lambda_i$},
    ]
    \addplot [
        domain=0:1,
        samples=100,
        color=blue,
    ]
    {1.52*x^3-3.88*x^2+3.36*x};
    \addplot [
        domain=-0:1, 
        samples=100, 
        color=red,
    ]
    {1};
    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Relationship between distribution coefficient and pledge rate}\label{func}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Distribution model in cycle}
During a distribution cycle, different number of pledge cycles will result in different distribution weights. The system determines the final NAX distribution amount based on the pledge quantity of each pledged user $V_{i, j}$ and the pledge weight \(f(T_{i, j})\). If the $N$ address is validly pledging (retaining enough assets) during the $i$ period, the $j$ address pledge is $V_{i,j}$ and the effective pledge period is $T_{i,j}$. Therefore, the number of NAX tokens that the address can be distributed to is $K_{i,j}$ as shown in the following formula.

\begin{equation}
  K_{i,j} = \frac{V_{i,j} f(T_{i,j})}{\sum_j V_{i,j} f(T_{i,j})} \lambda_i C_i
\end{equation}

Where \(f(T_{i,j})\) is the effective weight function for the pledge of the \(i\) user\(j\). The relationship between the pledge weight and the number of pledge cycles is as follows (the function relationship is shown in \ref{weight}).
  \begin{equation}
    f(T) = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{(aT+b)^2+c^2}-(aT+b)}{2}
  \end{equation}

The parameters $a$, $b$, $c$, etc... in the formula are discussed in the appendix. In general, within the same cycle, the system allocates the total amount of additional issuance tokens according to the number of pledges and the corresponding length of the pledge. In order to achieve a fair result, the more pledges and the longer the pledge, the higher the issuance number will be. At the same time, this method makes new pledge users more motivated while motivating existing pledges since the existing addresses weight will be retained at a considerable level. The design will reach the following scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{1cm}(a)]
  \item Early users involved in pledge have a greater probability of receiving more issuance.
  \item As the pledge rate increases, the number of system issuance will increase accordingly to encourage more people to join the pledge.
\end{enumerate}

        axis lines = left,

    \addplot [
        domain=0:365,

    {1-(sqrt((0.005*x-0.3)^2+0.2^2)-(0.005*x-0.3))/2};

        domain=-0:365,

    {1};
    \end{axis}

\subsubsection{Foundation Fees}
In order to enable the Nebulas Foundation to have more capabilities and initiative in ecosystem investment, incubation, support, activities, etc..., the additional issuance of $5\%$ will be transferred to NAX. The addresses managed by the foundation are subject to public scrutiny as well as its usage. The specific contents will be disclosed in the future.

\subsection{Contract Framework}
NAX is an extensible NRC20 contract consisting of a set of contracts which manage data and parameters of the entire framework via multi-signature contracts as shown in detail in \ref{fig:nax_framework}.
