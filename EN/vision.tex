\section {The Nebulas Vision}
Blockchain technology itself is not a brand-new technological innovation but rather a combination of a several of technologies (including cryptography, distributed systems, game theory, etc...) resulting in a novel innovation. Bitcoin ~\cite{Nakamoto2008} created the perfect design for "a decentralized electronic cash system" opening the door to the blockchain world. Next, Ethereum further proposed a smart contract blockchain framework with Turing complete code thus creating the ERC20 token paradigm which made it easier to finance new ideas via blockchain.

Blockchain technology has thus achieved unprecedented prosperity and development. The Nebulas White Paper ~\cite{TechWhitepaper} also presented its own blockchain concept and is committed to the vision of "to allow everyone to benefit fairly from decentralized collaboration." It also presented novel technologies such as Nebulas Rank (NR), Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP), Nebulas Force (NF) and Nebulas' unique approach to on-chain consensus entitled Proof of Devotion (PoD).

Over the past two years, Nebulas have learned from their strengths within the blockchain world. We understand that there will be further exploration and experimentation within blockchain collaboration. Our direction is not limited to the contents of the white paper and will include new attempts such as NextDAO.
