\section {The Nebulas Vision}
Blockchain technology itself is not a brand-new technological innovation, but as a combination of a series of technologies (including cryptography, distributed systems, game theory, etc.) resulting in model innovation. Bitcoin ~\cite{Nakamoto2008} created the perfect design for "a decentralized electronic cash system", opening the door to the blockchain world. Ethereum further proposed a smart contract blockchain framework with Turing completeness of the code, thus created the ERC20 token paradigm which made it easier to finance new ideas via blockchain.

Blockchain technology has thus achieved unprecedented prosperity and development. The Nebulas White Paper ~\cite{TechWhitepaper} also presented its own blockchain concept and is committed to the vision of "allow all to benefit fairly from decentralized collaboration." It also presented novel technologies such as Nebulas Rank (NR), Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP), Nebulas Force (NF) and Nebulas' unique approach to on-chain consensus entitled Proof of Devotion (PoD).

Over the past two years, Nebulas have learned from their strengths within the blockchain world. We understand that there will be further exploration and experimentation within blockchain collaboration, such as the NextDAO platform.
